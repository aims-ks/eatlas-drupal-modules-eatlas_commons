1,"Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone","At sea, threatening factors include direct interactions with fishing operations; ingestion of, and entanglement in, marine debris; contamination from pollutants; and over–fishing of prey species.","Global Drifters (920 of which have been recorded in the region 19ºS-15ºN, 110ºE-156ºE from 1990 to the present) were examined."
2,"Australia’s EEZ","The extent of the national study was the region 90o– 180oE and 0o–60oS.","Associated digital data that have demonstrated utility towards recognising and defining areas of high biodiversity value (‘hotspots’) with recent collections (of a subset of 721 ‘surrogate’ species) and Western Australian Museum has produced a significant database of c.3,800 ‘species’ (OTUs) from c.4,000 localities. Point specimen data of the ‘surrogate’ species are accompanied by modelled geographic."
3,"Australia’s deepwater demersal fish fauna","These maps enabled visual interpretation of species’ ranges and prevalence","The aims of the project were:• to locate, identify and collate existing information on the nature and distribution of marine sediments within the Australian Marine Jurisdiction;• to develop the MARS sediments database within Geoscience Australia and populate it with collated data to provide a national fundamental dataset, with publicly-available data;• to analyse and map readily available sediment data for the Northern Planning Area as a first priority to provide information for the Northern Region marine bioregionalisation;• to analyse and map an agreed selection of sediment data for the Australian region to provide information for the National Benthic Marine Bioregionalisation;• to detail in maps estimates of sediment mobilisation due to waves and tidal currents for Australian waters less than 300 m depth;• to strategically analyse the role of sediments and other seafloor characteristics information in marine bioregionalisations and, based on an assessment of relative benefits, recommend options for further research and data collection; and• to interact with the National Marine Bioregionalisation Integration project teams to ensure sediments and other seafloor characteristics information is applied correctly in the National Benthic Marine Bioregionalisation."
